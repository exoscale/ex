  "Like try but with support for ex-info/ex-data.

  If you pass a `catch-data` form it will try to match an
  ex-info :type key, or it's potential ancestors in the local hierarchy.

  ex-info clauses are checked first, in the order they were specified.
  catch-data will take as arguments a :type key, and a binding for
  the ex-data of the ex-info instance.

  (try
    [...]
    (catch-data ::something my-ex-data
